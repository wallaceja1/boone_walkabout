The title of this map is "A Short Walkabout in Boone, NC". This project shows the route of one of my favorite leisure walks around Boone. The route visits a couple of fantastic public parks, passes through the heart of Boone, and also stops at Stick Boy Bread Company. This project is a simple route map with four point markers and is built with coordinates stored within a .geoJSON file. The route was originally retrieved from Google Maps in the form of a .gpx file. The .gpx file was then converted to the .geoJSON referenced in the code. The coordinates within the .geoJSON were then moved into a JavaScript file to create the route. The map itself is built using Leaflet and jQuery libraries. The main functions of this map are the route, points, and tooltips for each point. The basemap used is appropriate for highlighting roadways, paths, and green areas and is property of OpenStreetMap.
